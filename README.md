<h1 style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#00C953">Looto</span> - port scanner</h1>

Looto - multi-thread port scanner with powerful user-friendly GUI. Port scanning can be the first step in a hacking or hacking prevention process, helping to identify potential targets for an attack. Scan your network to be sure you are safe. This software can use ONLY for educational purposes or for protection purposes! This software scanning needed ports via sockets, that sends pakcages to this ports. The adventage of this software is that it has a GUI and that can signficantly speed up the work. Speed of scanning depends on cores count of your processor.
