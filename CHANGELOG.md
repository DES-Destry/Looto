# Versions

## v1.0.1
- Now in host input user can type Domain name(in the previous version user can type only IP address)
- Stop button added. If you realized that you don't need to scan everything, but realized it too late, then you can complete the process. But the check of those ports that have started to be checked will not stop and you will have to wait for some time.
- Scanning has been significantyly accelerated. For scanning each port uses all available processors cores. In my case with Intel i5-2300 (4 cores) the speed increased by 4 times. This means that speed of scanning depends on cores count of your processor.

## v1.0.0
- First release version.
- Very simple port scanning with inputs for separated ports or range of ports.
- Simplified results showing.
