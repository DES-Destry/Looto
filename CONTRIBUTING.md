# Information for contributing

## Code
Application have a lot of C# summaries and commentaries, therefore I hope, that I don't need to explain code there.

## Branches and PR's
`master` branch need to store lastest stable version of application. 
Development of application with new and not stable features happens in the `dev` branch with another child branches for features or bugs.
For fixing bug or adding new feature you have to create child branch from `dev` and focus only on one bug or feature. If you want 2 features or bug-fixes - create 2 branches.
I don't apply pull requests to `master`!!!
